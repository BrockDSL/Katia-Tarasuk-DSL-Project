# Katia's Project on Visualization of Algorithms for Data Structures (tbd)

![Binary_Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/binary-tree-to-DLL.png)
 
## Introduction
Using Python, I will create a visual representation of the algorithms that are used to create a specific data structure, trees. To read more about trees, please visit: <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~clo/www/CMU/DataStructures/Lessons/lesson4_1.htm>


### Project Process



### Hopeful Conclusion
I want to be able to produce a program that will enable Computer Science (and other) students in better seeing how data trees work.
